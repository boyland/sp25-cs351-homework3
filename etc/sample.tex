\begin{enumerate}
   \item The \texttt{HexTileCollection} class extends \verb|AbstractCollection<HexTile>|
      What does this mean?
    %\item The \texttt{add} method calls \texttt{contains},
     % but we didn't write that method. How does it even compile?
    \item Why do we not include javadoc for some of the methods?
      When is that allowed?
    \item Why did we override \texttt{clear}? Wasn't there an inherited
      version we could have used?
    \item What about \texttt{size}?  Why did we override it?
    \item There's \texttt{if} in the implementation of \texttt{clear}
      that only sometimes does some tasks. What if we did that code
      all the time?  Would it be less efficient?  Or incorrect?  Explain!
    \item How come we don't override \verb|contains|?  Will the
      operation work?  How? (Or will it simply throw an exception?)
    \item The iterator's constructor sets the \texttt{currentIndex} to
      -1.  How is that legal?  (-1 is not a legal array index).
      In the previous assignment, the current index was equal to
      \texttt{manyItems} where there was no current element.  Why not
      use that concept?
    \item Why does \texttt{next} set \texttt{isCurrent} to true?
      What if it was already true?
      % The \texttt{next} method is not supposed to remove elements, is it?
    \item Which sequences of method calls should lead to a
      \texttt{NoSuchElementException}? \texttt{IllegalStateException}?
      \texttt{ConcurrentModificationException}? Come up with examples.
    \item What are \texttt{version} and \texttt{colVersion}?
      What do they have to do with \texttt{ConcurrentModificationException}?
%    \item OK we used an inherited version of \texttt{Collection}'s \texttt{remove}.
%      But this inherited version doesn't even know about our
%      \texttt{version} field. How can it update the version correctly?
    \item Why does the iterator's \texttt{remove} method update both
      \texttt{version} and \texttt{colVersion}? Wouldn't leaving them
      both alone accomplish the same thing?
    \item Why do we increment the version but decrement \texttt{manyItems}?
      Why not decrement both?
    \item Why does \verb|remove()| decrement the index?  Do we
      really want to go backwards?  Won't this mean we return the
      same element twice?
