  \begin{itemize}
    \item Why is the \texttt{fromString} method in
      \texttt{HexCoordinate} declared \texttt{static}?
    \item Why does \texttt{fromString} throw in several places but
      only catch in one place?  Why does it throw again inside the
      catch?
    \item In \texttt{HexBoardEditor} in the ``window closing''
      listener, it has a loop \texttt{for (HexTile h : seq)}. What does
      that mean?  How does it work?
    \item In the constructor, it adds an action listener on each
      ``terrain'' button.  Isn't \texttt{ActionListener} an interface?
      How can we make an instance of an interface?
    \item Why do we use a helper method \texttt{handleClick}?
      It's only used in one place?
    \item If we didn't ``return'' in the middle of
      \texttt{handleClick}, what bad thing would happen?  Explain!
    \item In order to draw the hex tiles on the screen, we need to
      have a graphics object.  Where do we get it?  How do we create
      it?  (trick question!)
  \end{itemize}
